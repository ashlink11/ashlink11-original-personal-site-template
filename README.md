## Things I would like to add in v2:

- For your team project, be sure to fork, clone, and individually redeploy your project to maintain individual ownership over the site showcased on your portfolio.
- Briefly describe your process for building each app. If you have a blog post that goes into detail for each project, link to that post.
- Make sure your projects are user-friendly to an unacquainted visitor.
  - The home page should explain the site’s functionality
  - **Random users might not want to sign up/sign in.** Consider adding dummy credentials on the homepage that they can use (and explain that), or make sure they can interact with the site without signing up.
- After you've completed the program, **revisit your projects and refactor them**.  Add new features.  Improve the user experience.  Fix any open issues.  Enhance the app's design aesthetic.
- **Clean up test data** and create some seed data that you can use to easily refresh your database.  If you want to get fancy, you can write a [scheduled task](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) that drops, recreates, and reseeds your database periodically.
