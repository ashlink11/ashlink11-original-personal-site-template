# Ash Grevelink's Portfolio

April 22, 2020 update:

Version 1 (MVP -- minimum-viable-product) completed April 21, 2020.

My portfolio site currently lives here with the live link of: https://hashbangash.github.io/dev/.

The repo you are currently viewing is not the repo where my commit history lives. My commit history is [here on this repo](https://github.com/hashbangash/hashbangash.github.io), which in turn has a live link of https://hashbangash.github.io/ (notice there is no `/dev`). That version has deployment issues with Bootstrap margins. I hope to address these in Version 2 of my portfolio. I plan on reading grunt, webpack and Bootstrap documentation and building the dev and production environments from scratch in order to solve these issues. I'm excited for that.
